Three main packages: Commons, infraestruture and Ui.

- **Commons:** Keep the domain rules (which in this case are none), models and aggregations models.
- **infraestruture:** Responsible for any data used in the application. Uses the Repository pattern.

2. **Retrofit2 + OkHttp:** For Network Request and Rx integration.
3. **Kotlin Extensions:** For view binding.
